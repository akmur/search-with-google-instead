## Purpose 

If you value your privacy and/or are scared of Google's monopoly,
you should be using alternative tools - like web search enginge
[duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com).

It is a great engine and most of the time results are as good as 
those from Google. In many ways (e.g. keyboard navigation) it is 
superior. 

But sometimes you don't find what you are looking for and you have
to fallback to Google. Then, this plugin saves you time and effort
of typing/copy pasting you search term again.
